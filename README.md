## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
-[The font family I imported](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Red+Hat+Display:wght@500;700;900&display=swap)


### What I learned

I learnt how to use more css properties and html elements

CSS properties such as 
```CSS
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-size:100%;
background-attachment: scroll;
box-shadow:0px 5px 5px #cecaca;
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: space-between;
```
```HTML
<div>
class
id
```


### Continued development

- I'm still interested in learning more CSS properties in order to add more styles to my work.

- Adding tailwindcss to my work in future works will be great. So I will also develop my skills in that area as well
